description: >-
  Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
  largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open
  curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,
  Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural
  width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in
  humanist and serif types.


  This is the regular family, which can be used alongside the Roboto Condensed
  family and the Roboto Slab family.
